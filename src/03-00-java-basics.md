# Java Basics

For FRC programming, Team 100 uses the Java programming language. In this section, we will begin to bridge from VEX programming over to Java programming while explaining programming concepts in more depth.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

In order to write Java code, you will need the WPILib Software and Driver Station.

> If you would like a team-provided computer, please contact an IT student or mentor

To install your software, please visit [this website](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/index.html) and follow all of the steps **excluding** *Installing LabVIEW for FRC (LabVIEW only)*.

You will need to ask a Control Systems mentor or veteran for the registration key for National Instruments (Driver Station).

## A Note for Mac Users

If you have a Mac, you may be unable to use certain features. The FRC software was designed around using PCs, and as of the time of writing this, FRC Game Tools (including Driver Station) are PC only. Please contact an IT student or mentor to have a team laptop assigned.
